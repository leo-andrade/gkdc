          <p class="lead">Thank goodness for our referral to GKDC from a good friend! Both my pups have enjoyed daycare, my shy girl loves hanging out at the front desk with Barbara and my energetic baby boy loves playing with his pup and human friends! During daycare the staff not only let the pups play but interact with them too. They post pictures on Facebook so it's easy to see your pup having a great time! Isabella recommended training for my boy, we started with basic classes and progressed to puppy parkour and public manners classes. These classes helped him gain confidence and gave me the tools to help him in a positive manner. I continue to use the things we learned in class with both my pups and our foster pups too! We've utilized pet sitting also, it was nice to know that my pup was in a loving home while I'm was out of town and I got text updates too! All of the staff at Good Karma are amazing and I always know my babies are safe and having fun when they are there!</p>

          <p class="lead">Three years ago,  I was referred to Good Karma Dog Center when my Labrador retriever was a 6 month old puppy having many issues, the most important being socialization. 
            The staff slowly introduced Quinn to the dogs that were enrolled at Good Karma.
            Quinn also had access to in home training and classes offered which helped with
            socialization, training and a general understanding of dogs.  The positive reinforcement has helped Quinn become a happy dog.  Happy dogs are good dogs!!  Quinn waits at the door to go see her friends everyday.  When Quinn is at Good Karma, I know she is in good hands and she is happy!!!!</p>

          <p class="lead">We have two rescue dogs, a male/female bonded pair, they were found wandering after a hurricane. The pair had been kenneled for 8 months prior to us adopting them.
            Our female, Ursula, loves going to Good Karma Daycare every week! It provides socialization and stimulation for her. 
            Nash, our male, came to us with many issues. He was underweight and showed signs of stress (hair loss, skin sensitivity). Nash was extremely distrustful of most people, especially men, Barbara and Isabella at Good Karma did an evaluation and found him unable to attend daycare but suggested we start with obedience classes. We went to our first class with Isabella two years ago, since then Nash has attended many classes. He absolutely loves learning new things and gets super excited to go to class. 
            He has learned so much but the most amazing thing is that he is a much more confident, trusting and happy dog. Isabella has taken the time to work with Nash (and us) and we've gone from Nash being an especially reactive dog (barking wildly when he would see another dog) to one that will focus on his commands while dogs are nearby. Of course this is a journey we are on but the strides Nash has made are tremendous. We could not have done this without Isabella, Barbara and the entire staff at Good Karma. 
            Good Karma is wonderful for our Ursula but it's been transformative for Nash. Their experience and patience with "difficult" dogs like Nash has been beyond helpful for us and I couldn't recommend them more!</p>
